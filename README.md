# Final-Project-Quiz-Game

# This is the Readme file. In this VERY SIMPLE Final Project, I attempted to make a small little quiz game with 5 questions where the answers seemed very interesting 
to me for people to know. Hopefully I can improve in the future, having the available time to dedicate to coding. Since it has never been near one of top priorities
because of current life parameters, I would only get going once I have the availability.
